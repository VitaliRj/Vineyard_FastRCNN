# Vineyard_FastRCNN

This project presents an object/obstacle detector using a Fast Region-based Convolutional Network method (Fast R-CNN) in an agricultural environment. 

Convolutional Neural Networks have significantly improved image classification and detection accuracy in recent years [1]. Especially complex scenes and objects with a high variety of optical features and surfaces can be detected with increasing confidence.  Agriculture is brilliant example for heterogenous geometries and surfaces that introduce innumerable difficulties for traditional computer vision approaches. 

Having a look into modern vineyards, a progressively common method of weed control is to mechanically/physically remove weed beneath the plants. Hence the implement, removing the weed, has to detect the plants and other obstacles to avoid collisions.  The state of the art is to “feel” if there is an obstacle in front of the implement as shown here:

This physical interaction can damage the plants bark, thus allowing fungus to grow. Additional benefits of having a contactless system can be:

-	Data mining for smart farms,
-	Autonomous systems,
-	Health monitoring.
